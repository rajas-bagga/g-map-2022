# G Map

A very simple & fast port scanner written in python. It uses multiple threads to scan all ports and can perhaps even detect the service the port is running sometimes.

It's usage is pretty simple, just shoot
```python gmap.py``` on your terminal and it'll ask you about the ip you wanna scan via STDIN.
